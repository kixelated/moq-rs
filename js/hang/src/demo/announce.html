		<li><a href="publish.html">Publish a broadcast.</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Tips:</h3>
	<p>
		The <code>internal/origins/hostname</code> broadcasts are used by the clustering mechanism.
		That's right, MoQ relays use MoQ to discover other nodes!
		These internal tracks won't be discoverable once authentication is implemented.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <span style="font-style: italic; color: grey">0s ago</span> is based on the client.
		There's no timestamp that gets serialized over the wire; this is just to demonstate that these announcements are
		live.
	</p>
	<p>
		Try creating a new broadcast!
		The updates are fully live (no polling) so any changes are reflected immediately.
		For example, try: <code class="language-bash">just pub tos</code>
	</p>
